Conceptual Unification Axiom: Project SummaryThis project defines a new model for relativistic particle kinematics based on a purely geometric vector cross-product: $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{c}$.
The core purpose is to provide a complete, dimensionally consistent framework that explains the universal speed limit and the energy-momentum curve without using the Lorentz factor ($\gamma$) 
or requiring time dilation as a cause. The model asserts that a particle's Kinematic Resistance collapses to zero as its intrinsic field ($\mathbf{G}$) aligns perfectly with the velocity vector ($\mathbf{c}$).
This alignment is actively controlled by the particle's internal electromagnetic structure, which dictates the geometry of its motion.
The overall goal was achieved using computational equivalence with Special Relativity using this simpler, geometric causality.
